# Meadow simulation
Multithreaded meadow simulation using C++17 and CLion IDE. The was project created for a university course on operating systems (Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology).

In this simulation there are animals that can eat, drink water and think. It is done in a loop until an animal is alive. Conditional variables were used to synchronize threads.

**Threads**:
- Cow (eats grass),
- Rabbit (eats grass and can be eaten by a wolf),
- Wolf (hunts only at night),
- Sun (day and night cycle).

**Resources**:
- Pond (animals can drink water),
- Rabbit Hole (rabbits try to escape there when hunted by a wolf),
- Grass (eaten by cows and rabbits).
